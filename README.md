# at

Rogue like farm simulator written in C using curses. This is very much
a work in progress currently.

To compile, run `make linux`.  We try to make `at` portable, so you
should probably be able to compile it under BSD/Darwin too.

To compile documentation run `make docs`. You will need the `doxygen`
package installed.

Join us on IRC. We can be found on LiberaChat in `##at`.
